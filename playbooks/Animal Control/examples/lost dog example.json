You can also go to https://www.cityofsacramento.org/Community-Development/Animal-Care/Lost-and-Found.Our online listing of stray animals is updated every hour. The online listing only displays LIVE animals that were either picked up by one of our animal control officers or brought to the shelter by concerned citizens. Deceased animals are NOT shown on the website, but their descriptions and location found are listed in a binder at the shelters front office.  Animals dropped off to the shelter will be held for a minimum of 3 days in order to give an owner the opportunity to look for his/her lost pet. The hold is extended if an animal has a microchip or if an animal is wearing a license tag, a rabies tag, and/or a personalized tag. If we receive information that the owner has been incarcerated or hospitalized, we will extend the hold in those situations as well. Once the holding period has ended, an animal may be placed for adoption, transferred to another shelter or rescue group, or be placed in the shelter's foster care system. An animal may be euthanized immediately if the animal is suffering from a serious medical condition or injury and/or is not responding to treatment. Also, if an animal does not pass the behavior evaluation, the animal may be euthanized.",
